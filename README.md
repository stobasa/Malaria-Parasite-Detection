Malaria Parasite Detection in Thin Blood Smear Images Using Smartphone

Abstract

Malaria is a blood disease caused by the Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the
bite of female Anopheles mosquito. It disproportionately affects resource poor areas in the world
resulting in loss of life and great economic burden. According to the CDC website, 216 million
cases of malaria occurred in 2016 and 445,000 of them were fatal. Most of them were children.
Initially, patients infected with malaria will develop flu like symptoms. In severe cases patients
may develop respiratory difficulties and comma. It is very important to diagnose malaria as soon
as possible to prevent spread of the disease in the community. Microscopists commonly examine
thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their
accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and
uninfected cells. Such an examination could be onerous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in
poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods
using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using
hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional
variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a
class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results. Automated
malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models toward classifying
parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally
determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical
validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for this
purpose.
